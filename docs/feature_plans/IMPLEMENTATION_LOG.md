### 🎨 Design Pattern
**Consistent with Gift Vouchers Page**: Followed the established pattern from `web/src/pages/Vouchers.tsx` for dedicated modal design and functionality.

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

#### State Management
```typescript
// Modal and form state
const [createModalOpen, setCreateModalOpen] = useState(false)
const [createLoading, setCreateLoading] = useState(false)
const [createForm, setCreateForm] = useState<FormData>({...})
const [selectedCreateCustomer, setSelectedCreateCustomer] = useState<Customer | null>(null)
const [selectedCreateStoreId, setSelectedCreateStoreId] = useState('')
```

#### Form Validation Examples
```typescript
// Hand Bills validation
if (!createForm.amount || createForm.amount <= 0) {
  setError('Please enter a valid amount')
  return
}
if (!createForm.items_description || createForm.items_description.trim() === '') {
  setError('Please enter items description')
  return
}

// Sales Orders validation  
if (!selectedCreateCustomer) {
  setError('Please select a customer')
  return
}
if (createForm.advance_paid && createForm.advance_paid > createForm.total_estimated_amount) {
  setError('Advance payment cannot exceed total estimated amount')
  return
}
```

#### API Integration
- **Hand Bills**: `handBillsApi.create(requestData)`
- **Sales Orders**: `salesOrdersApi.create(requestData)`
- **Store Selection**: `storesApi.getAll()` for multi-store users
- **Customer Quick Add**: Leveraged existing CustomerSelector component

### 📊 User Experience Benefits

#### Before Enhancement
- Users had to navigate to Sales page → Open Sales Entry Modal → Select appropriate tab
- 5 tabs visible with irrelevant options for specific contexts
- Potential confusion and slower workflow

#### After Enhancement  
- Direct "Create" buttons on relevant management pages
- Context-focused modals with only relevant fields
- Consistent with Gift Vouchers page pattern
- Reduced clicks and navigation friction
- Clear, intuitive workflow

### 🛡️ Security & Validation Maintained

#### Role-Based Access Control
- **Hand Bills**: Only store_manager, super_user, accounts_incharge can create
- **Sales Orders**: Available to all roles  
- **Store Selection**: Required for super_user/accounts_incharge with multi-store access

#### Customer Quick Add Validation
- **Mandatory Fields**: Customer name and phone number required
- **Phone Deduplication**: Automatic detection of existing customers
- **Auto-Creation**: Seamless customer creation during transaction entry

#### Form Validation
- **Required Fields**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Data Types**: Proper number validation for amounts and payments
- **Business Rules**: Advance payment cannot exceed total estimated amount
